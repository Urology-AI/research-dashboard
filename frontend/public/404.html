    <!-- 
      This file is a template. During build, Create React App will inject script tags into index.html.
      The GitHub Actions workflow will copy the built index.html to 404.html after build.
      
      When GitHub Pages serves 404.html for a route like /research-dashboard/login,
      the browser URL stays as /research-dashboard/login, and React Router will read
      window.location.pathname and route correctly (with basename="/research-dashboard").
